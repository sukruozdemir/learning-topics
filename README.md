# 3. Microservice


Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are

-   Highly maintainable and testable
-   Loosely coupled
-   Independently deployable
-   Organized around business capabilities
-   Owned by a small team

The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.
